For my final year project, We developed an Ayurvedic drug recommendation system. 
It suggests appropriate Ayurvedic drugs based on disease, severity, gender, and age using Python's machine learning libraries like pandas and sklearn.
The web application was built using Flask, with HTML and CSS for the frontend.

Thanks for your visit!👍
